## THOUGHTS ON CHARACTER VIEW 

- I want the user to be able to view a single character from out of the my_character list.
- User clicks on button "view"
- User is directed to the erb "view_character"
- Depending on where the user clicked in the character list, that single character will be displayed to her.
- Single character view is also the mode for editing, whereas editing opens the character with a form and the current content of the character Object.
